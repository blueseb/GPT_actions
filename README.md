### Step 1: Create a Custom GPT
- Access the OpenAI platform and navigate to the custom models section.
- Create a new custom GPT model by providing the necessary details.

### Step 2: Download GitHub OpenAPI Specifications
- Visit GitHub's OpenAPI repository and download the YAML file containing the specifications.

### Step 3: Upload OpenAPI Specifications to the Custom GPT
- In the custom GPT configuration panel, upload the downloaded OpenAPI YAML file.

### Step 4: Write a Simplified OpenAPI Spec for `listGists`
- Review the full OpenAPI specifications and write a simplified version for `listGists`.
- Update the custom GPT configuration with the simplified spec.

### Step 5: Create a GitHub API Key
- Log into your GitHub account and navigate to the API keys section in the developer settings.
- Generate a new API key with permissions for gist access.

### Step 6: Paste the API Key into GPT Configuration
- Enter the generated API key in the custom GPTâ€™s configuration panel.

### Step 7: Test the Integration
- Test the `listGists` functionality in your custom GPT model.
- Ensure the model correctly lists gists from your GitHub account.

### Step 8: Add More Actions
- Add more GitHub actions (like `readGist`, `updateGist`) by repeating steps 3 to 7.
- Each time, update the OpenAPI spec and the GPT configuration accordingly.

### Conclusion
This guide walks you through the process of integrating ChatGPT with GitHub Gists. By following these steps, you can enhance your custom GPT model with GitHub's API functionality.
